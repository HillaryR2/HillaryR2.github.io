	  <p> <h3> Project Statement #1: </h3> <p>
	  <p> My topic is about social media negatively impacting teenagers in nowadays society. This topic is
important to me because it’s a worldwide problem most teenagers experience. This ongoing issue
can affect their mental health in many ways, such as: develop anxiety, body dysmorphia and
depression, cause them to isolate themselves due to the feeling of loneliness or may embrace
social media more than real life, etc. Some important information I would like people to know is
that social media is a big factor of teenagers having low self-esteem due to unrealistic body
images and looks they see on an everyday basis. For this collage, I chose all pictures that I found
meaningful and are able to bring awareness to this.<p>
