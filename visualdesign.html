	  <p><h3> Project #1: Activism Project </h3> </p>

	  <p> <h3> Project Statement #1: </h3> </p>
	  <p> My topic is about social media negatively impacting teenagers in nowadays society. This topic is
important to me because itâ€™s a worldwide problem most teenagers experience. This ongoing issue
can affect their mental health in many ways, such as: develop anxiety, body dysmorphia and
depression, cause them to isolate themselves due to the feeling of loneliness or may embrace
social media more than real life, etc. Some important information I would like people to know is
that social media is a big factor of teenagers having low self-esteem due to unrealistic body
images and looks they see on an everyday basis. For this collage, I chose all pictures that I found
meaningful and are able to bring awareness to this.</p>

	  <p> <h3> Project Statement #2: </h3> </p>
	  <p>To come up with my animals I decided that I wanted my mythical creature to be fast, have wings, and
have good senses. My animal has the ability to fly, run fast, and it can also smell, hear, and see
anything within a 1 mile radius. To create my creature I looked up 3 different animals which are: a
tiger, eagle and seabird. After that I used Adobe Photoshop to merge my 3 animals and create my
mythical creature. It has the body of a tiger, the head of an eagle, and wings of a seabird.</p>

 <p><h3> Project #3: Making Mandalas </h3> </p>

	  <p> <h3> Project Statement #3: </h3> </p>
	  <p>I made this project using Adobe Photoshop where I chose the type of flower I wanted, which was
a rose. I then placed 8 roses and formed a circle with them. After I chose the placement and type
of flower I wanted, I repeatedly pasted the same 8 roses to make the circle smaller and rotated it
a couple of degrees each time. The colors I used are dark and light red, black, and gray. What I
noticed about repeating the same steps is that I was able to create a spiral-like illusion.</p>


 <p><h3> Project #4: My Pixel Art Character </h3> </p>
<img src="HillaryR_PixelArt.png" width="400" height="300" alt="Pixel Art">
	  <p> <h3> Project Statement #4: </h3> </p>
	  <p>I used Adobe Photoshop to create my pixel character. I started by looking for the right head size that
would allow me to have the face features I wanted and what size the body would be. My character is
a female wearing a black dress, red heels, gold earrings, and long red hair. My character would be in
a game where she fights against crime and bad guys. Her purpose in the game is to be undercover
and investigate the bad guys.</p>


 <p><h3> Project #5: What's Your Vibe? </h3> </p>
<img src="My project-1.png" width="400" height="300" alt="What's Your Vibe Project">
	  <p> <h3> Project Statement #5: </h3> </p>
	  <p>I started this project by coming up with 6 words that describe me and my personality. I used
Adobe Express to put together all the pictures that matched my 6 words. I included 8 pictures
because I wanted to demonstrate and picture more broadly some words I used. I used pictures
that were meaningful because I wanted my collage to be something relatable and eye-catching
for those who view it. I think my collage matches my aesthetic because it represents my
everyday moods and actions.</p>
