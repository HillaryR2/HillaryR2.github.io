	  <p> My topic is about social media negatively impacting teenagers in nowadays society. This topic is
important to me because itâ€™s a worldwide problem most teenagers experience. This ongoing issue
can affect their mental health in many ways, such as: develop anxiety, body dysmorphia and
depression, cause them to isolate themselves due to the feeling of loneliness or may embrace
social media more than real life, etc. Some important information I would like people to know is
that social media is a big factor of teenagers having low self-esteem due to unrealistic body
images and looks they see on an everyday basis. For this collage, I chose all pictures that I found
meaningful and are able to bring awareness to this.</p>

	  <p>To come up with my animals I decided that I wanted my mythical creature to be fast, have wings, and
have good senses. My animal has the ability to fly, run fast, and it can also smell, hear, and see
anything within a 1 mile radius. To create my creature I looked up 3 different animals which are: a
tiger, eagle and seabird. After that I used Adobe Photoshop to merge my 3 animals and create my
mythical creature. It has the body of a tiger, the head of an eagle, and wings of a seabird.</p>
